# BlogPage

## Features
Functional Tumblr-Style blog page section that allows for photos, text, and file uploads. There is also a log page that displays a week's worth of log entries at a time. The log page uses URL parameters to access a specific week (can enter any date and that week's data will automatically be displayed). When a user is signed in that data can be added to the current day, hours can be modified for the current week, descriptions can be modified for any day.

## Improvements for the future
This application was created for personal use at a time when I had limitied knowledge of the Spring framework. For future similar projects I intend to implement the more powerful features of the Spring framework because I realise now that It was not neccessary for me to write out the JSON or directly write my SQL queries for JDBC. I will also implement password hashing in the future to help keep password email combinations safe in the event of a compromised database. <br />

The styling choices are a bit out of date for the current expectations of webpages, so I intend on doing a better job with conforming to more modern design.
